			<h1>Civilization VI</h1>

					<h2>
						Gathering Storm, the second expansion to Civilization VI, the world around you is more alive than ever before.<br>
						Chart a path to victory for your people by developing new advanced technologies and engineering projects and <br>
						negotiating with the global community in the World Congress on critical issues.<br>
						The choices you make in the game will influence the world ecosystem and could impact the future of the entire planet.<br>
						Natural disasters like floods, storms, and volcanoes can pillage or destroy your Improvements and Districts<br>
						- but they may also refresh and enrich the lands after they pass.<br>
						In addition to these new systems, Civilization VI: Gathering Storm introduces eight new civilizations and nine new leaders.<br>
						Seven new world wonders can be constructed, as well as a variety of new units, districts, buildings, and improvements.<br>
						ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS<br>
						Volcanoes, storms (blizzards, sand storms, tornados, hurricanes), climate change, floods, and droughts.<br>
						POWER AND CONSUMABLE RESOURCES<br>
						Strategic resources play an additional role in Gathering Storm. These resources are now consumed in power plants to generate<br>
						electricity for your cities. Initially you'll be powering your most advanced buildings by burning carbon-based resources like Coal and Oil<br>
						, but renewable energy sources also unlock as you progress to current-day technologies. Your choices about resource usage will directly affect <br>
						the world's temperature and can cause melting ice caps and rising sea levels.<br>
						ENGINEERING PROJECTS<br>
						Shape the world around your empire to overcome unfavorable land conditions by making improvements like canals, dams, tunnels and railroads. <br>
						When settling cities, consider the flood risk to coastal lowland areas, but keep in mind that in the late-game, new technologies like Flood <br>
						Barriers can be used to protect these tiles</h2><br>
