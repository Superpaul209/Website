<h2>THE CITY MUST SURVIVE</h2><br>

<h3>Frostpunk is a society survival game where heat means life and <br>every decision comes with a cost. You face the task of <br>building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary <br>for your people to survive</h3<
<br>
<h2>MAINTAIN HOPE</h2><br>

<h3>Survival is about hope and the will to live. Your ability to <be>spark and maintain them both in your people will be a <br>deciding factor in your success.<br></h3>
<br>
<h2>MAKE THE LAW</h2><br>
<h3>

Society is a group of people who abide by the same rules and <br>share similar beliefs. Establish laws that regulate the <br>existence of your growing society. Decide on their working <br>routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of <br>everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the <br>moral condition of your society is as important as securing <br>the basic means to keep them fed and safe<br></h3>
