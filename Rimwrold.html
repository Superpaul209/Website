			<h2>
				RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.<br>
				You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.<br>
				RimWorld is a story generator. It's designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival.<br>
				It works by controlling the "random" events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller.<br>
				There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.<br>
				Your colonists are not professional settlers - they're crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit.<br>
				You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You'll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and<br>
				turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.<br>
